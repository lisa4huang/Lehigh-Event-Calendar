# Lehigh-Event-Calendar
Forget fiddling with calendars. This app shows all upcoming Lehigh University events in one spot and lets you pick ones you're interested in to drop straight into your virtual calendar. This project started as a fun way to finally put the dusty old e-ink Kindle to use instead of squinting at oversized academic calendar printouts taped to the wall.
